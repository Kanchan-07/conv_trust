This could involve using libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib.\n\nWhich direction sounds most appealing to you?",

While there's no guaranteed 'win' formula, projects that leverage publicly available datasets and offer clear, demonstrable value are generally well-received. Consider looking at: public health data (e.g., CDC data, WHO data), environmental data (e.g., air quality), or open-source financial datasets. Creating visualizations that highlight key insights is also important. I cannot predict what scores well though, as judging criteria vary between hackathons and may depend on the judges.
